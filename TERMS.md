# Merets™ Platform Glossary (Canonical)

**Merets is a reputation-and-earning platform where youth build real-world skill, trust, and income through verified work.**

---

## Core Concepts

### Merets (noun)
The platform and the unit system.

*"Are you on Merets?"*  
*"She earned her first Merets last summer."*

Merets is both:
- The ecosystem (app, marketplace, reputation network)
- The standard of value within it

### Meret (noun, singular) / Merets (plural)
The core unit of value on the platform.

- One Meret ≈ one hour of meaningful, verified effort
- Merets are earned, not given
- Merets are not money, but directly influence pay, trust, and access

*"I earned 6 Merets this week."*  
*"High-Meret earners get paid faster."*

### Meretous (adjective)
A respected, high-standard earner.

- Signals consistency, reliability, and pride in work
- Cultural compliment, not just a stat

*"She's extremely Meretous."*  
*"That's a Meretous way to handle a job."*

## Roles (Neutral, Future-Proof)

### User
Any person on Merets.

All users can earn, provide, or review depending on context.

### Earner
A user who completes work and earns Merets.

- Youth, teens, students, early-career users
- Earners build Rep over time
- High Rep unlocks autonomy and faster pay

### Provider
A user who posts work, tasks, or opportunities.

- Parents
- Households
- Local businesses
- Certified providers (later)

Providers:
- Define scope
- Set pay
- Review quality
- Benefit from trusted earners

## Work & Activity

### Ment (noun)
A job, task, or commitment posted on Merets.

- Short for commitment
- Internal term (not always customer-facing)
- Clean, flexible, and brand-aligned

*"I picked up two Ments today."*  
*"That Ment auto-accepted because of your Rep."*

**✅ Recommendation: Yes, keep "Ment" as the internal unit for work.**

### Commitment
The formal agreement to complete a Ment.

**Key idea:**  
You don't earn Merets for trying — only for honoring commitments.

### Execution
The act of doing the work.

Tracked by:
- Time spent
- Evidence (optional)
- Quality review

---

## Reputation & Trust

### Rep (short for Reputation)
A long-term trust score, measured on a 0–100 scale.

Rep reflects:
- Reliability
- Quality
- Experience

**Rep is slow to build and fast to lose at high levels.**

#### Rep Bands (Illustrative)
- **0–25** → New earner, guided
- **25–50** → Reliable, building momentum
- **50–80** → Trusted, fewer approvals
- **80+** → Elite trust tier (auto-accept)
- **90+** → Word-is-gold tier (instant/advance pay eligible)

*"She's an 82 Rep — no approval needed."*

### Auto-Accept
A privilege unlocked at high Rep.

- Earners can accept Ments without provider approval
- Still fully accountable for outcomes
- Trust is earned, not assumed.

### Advance Pay
Elite unlock (Rep 90+).

- Earners may be paid immediately upon acceptance
- Failure results in Rep damage, not just withheld pay
- This mirrors real-world professional trust.

---

## Quality & Review

### Quality Rating
Per-Ment review (e.g., 1–5 stars).

Used to calculate:
- Merets earned
- Rep adjustments
- Access to higher-value Ments

### Reliability
Consistency in honoring commitments.

Measured by:
- Completion rate
- On-time delivery
- Drop-offs / failures

### Experience
Depth and breadth of completed work.

Measured by:
- Total Merets earned
- Task categories
- Complexity tiers

---

## Economy (No-Money Core)

### Ledger
The immutable record of:
- Merets earned
- Rep changes
- Earnings owed/paid

**Merets does not hold money.**  
**It records truth.**

### Earnings
Real-world money tied to Ments.

- Paid off-platform (early versions)
- Logged in Merets for transparency
- Never escrowed by default

---

## Cultural Norms (Very Important)

1. **Merets are not gamified points** — they represent real effort
2. **High Rep is rare** — not everyone should reach the top
3. **Failure has consequences** — especially at high trust levels
4. **Language matters** — Merets is a culture, not an app feature

## One-Line Positioning (Internal North Star)

**Merets is where young people earn money and reputation by honoring real commitments.**
